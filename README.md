# ART STUDIO
Art Studio wants to increase creativity and wants to show that anyone can learn to make art. The creative process increases well-being and, just like physical activity, it gives a better mood, greater self-awareness and more energy. By offering membership at different levels, the site has great development potential as the number of members increases.
Art Studio a fictitious company, created as part of project work at the Code Institute.

## UX

### Site Purpose:
To increase awareness around the creative process and show all benefits the creation has to body and soul by step by step tutorials and inspirering lifestories.

### Site Goal:
The first goal is to attracts new user to sign up and become members. 
The user should clearly understand what is being provided and should easly navigate on the page.  

### Business Strategy:
![Level of memberships](/assets/images/membership.webp)

Art Studio is a fictive company but I want to show the commercial thought behind it anyway.
With people signing up you can offer different memberships and It can therefore be a page that has room to grow in step with members.

To attracts new members the site need to frequently upload classes, content and have other artist lifestories. 

### Target Market
![Target market in four groups](assets/images/readme-marketsegment.webp)
Art Studio´s is a business to consumer company and the target market are mainly women 20-65 + years old.

### Communication
Communication plan will focus on: frequently update with new online classes, success stories and artwork from members
Social channels will mainly be Facebook and instagram
Directly email to those who sign up with automatic email

## Design

### Colour Scheme:
The page is filled with images that will inspires to create. The page's colors can therefore not take over the page's message. The combination of #64A0A0 and small fragment of #F699CD gives a pleasant impression that does not overwhelm the user.

Material, as buttons and presentations are designed so the user feel recognition, no matter where on the site he/she is on. 

The headings on all pages is in #64A0A0, except for on the sign up page where it is #F699CD since the background is black I want the heading to stand out.

### Typography
League Spartan is selected in headings, navigation and buttons
Montserrat  is selected as the main font in the running text.

The combiantion of theese two fonts gives a serious but playful impression.

Buttons and presentations are made in canva.com

### Imagery
Hero image on first page and on signup page are taken from canva.com.
