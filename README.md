# ART STUDIO
Art Studio wants to increase creativity and wants to show that anyone can learn to make art. The creative process increases well-being and, just like physical activity, it gives a better mood, greater self-awareness and more energy. By offering membership at different levels, the site has great development potential as the number of members increases.
Art Studio a fictitious company, created as part of project work at the Code Institute.

## UX

### Site Purpose:
To increase awareness around the creative process and show all benefits the creation has to body and soul by step by step tutorials and inspirering lifestories.

### Site Goal:
The first goal is to attracts new user to sign up and become members. 
The user should clearly understand what is being provided and should easily navigate on the page.  

### Business Strategy:
![Level of memberships](/assets/images/membership.webp)
Art Studio is a fictive company but I want to show the commercial thought behind it anyway.
By offering different level of memberships the has room to grow in line with increased revenue.
To attracts new members the site needs to frequently upload new classes, content and have other artist lifestories. 

### Target Market
![Target market in four groups](assets/images/readme-marketsegment.webp)
Art Studio´s is a business to consumer company and the target market are mainly women 20-65 + years old.

### Communication
Communication plan will focus on: frequently update with new online classes, success stories and artwork from members.
Social channels will mainly be Facebook and instagram, since the target market the market are on those channels.

## Design

### Wireframe
![Overwiew of layout](assets/images/readme-wireframe.png)
To give a general overwiew of the layout and content I made a sketch in canva.com. 

### Colour Scheme:
The page is filled with images that will inspires to create. The page's colors can therefore not take over the page's message. The combination of #64A0A0 and small fragment of #F699CD gives a pleasant impression that does not overwhelm the user.
Material, as buttons and presentations are designed so the user feel recognition, no matter where on the site he/she is on. 
The headings on all pages is in #64A0A0, except for on the sign up page where it is #F699CD since the background is black I want the heading to stand out.
![Color schem](assets/images/readme-colorscheme.webp)

### Typography
There are two fonts used:

- League Spartan in headings, navigation and buttons
- Montserrat  is selected as the main font in the running text.
The combiantion of theese two fonts gives a serious but playful impression.
Buttons and presentations are made in canva.com.

### Imagery

Hero image on first page and on signup page are taken from canva.com.
All other images belongs to me, Camilla Dahlström. The artworks are made by me and gallery pictures are taken when I run an art gallery in Täby Centrum, 2021-2023.
All images have been exported in adoble Photoshop to WEBP-format.

  In the end of the section it is a clickable link to the sign-up page on the right side of the page. 

- Since the goal for the page is to get sign-ups from the users I´m highlighting benefits of become a member. I am also presenting three different levels with 
  three different monthly fees. If this was a LIVE site this part should be connected to stripe for immediately payment-opportunity.
