# ART STUDIO
Art Studio wants to increase creativity and wants to show that anyone can learn to make art. The creative process increases well-being and, just like physical activity, it gives a better mood, greater self-awareness and more energy. By offering membership at different levels, the site has great development potential as the number of members increases.
Art Studio a fictitious company, created as part of project work at the Code Institute.
